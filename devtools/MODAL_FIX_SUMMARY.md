# Modal Display Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
When loading the page, users were "bombarded with modals" - the 'About' and 'Contact' modals were showing up automatically on page load.

## Root Cause
The `aboutModal` and `contactModal` HTML elements were missing the `style="display: none;"` attribute, causing them to be visible by default.

## Solution Applied
Added `style="display: none;"` to both problematic modals:

### Before:
```html
<div id="aboutModal" class="modal">
<div id="contactModal" class="modal">
```

### After:
```html
<div id="aboutModal" class="modal" style="display: none;">
<div id="contactModal" class="modal" style="display: none;">
```

## Verification
- ✅ **Commander Modal**: Already had `style="display: none;"` - working correctly
- ✅ **Card Modal**: Uses `.card-modal` class with `display: none;` in CSS - working correctly  
- ✅ **About Modal**: Now has `style="display: none;"` - fixed
- ✅ **Contact Modal**: Now has `style="display: none;"` - fixed

## Test Results
- **Server running**: http://localhost:8081
- **Page loads cleanly**: No modals appear on initial load
- **Commander modal functionality**: Still works as implemented
- **About/Contact modals**: Only show when clicked from menu

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The modal bombardment issue has been completely resolved. Users will now see a clean page load with no unwanted modals appearing automatically.

All modal functionality remains intact:
- Commander modal opens when "Commander" format is selected
- About modal opens when "About" is clicked in menu
- Contact modal opens when "Contact" is clicked in menu
- Card modals open when cards are clicked
